# Groundwater Basics in Thailand

## Overview
Groundwater is a critical water resource in Thailand, particularly in agricultural regions like Suphan Buri.

## Aquifer Systems
Thailand has several major aquifer systems:
- **Shallow aquifers (0-50m)**: Seasonal, vulnerable to contamination
- **Medium aquifers (50-150m)**: Most productive, optimal for wells
- **Deep aquifers (150m+)**: More stable but expensive to access

## Optimal Drilling Depths
Research shows that wells drilled to 80-150m depth have:
- Success rate: 75-85%
- Sustainable water yield: 5-15 mÂ³/hour
- Lower contamination risk
- Cost-effective operation

## Seasonal Variations
Thailand has two distinct seasons affecting groundwater:

### Rainy Season (May-October)
- Higher water table
- Increased recharge
- Better drilling conditions
- Success rate increases by 10-15%

### Dry Season (November-April)
- Lower water table
- Reduced flow rates
- More challenging drilling
- Higher risk of well failure

## Regional Characteristics - Suphan Buri
Suphan Buri province characteristics:
- Average depth to water: 10-30m
- Productive depth range: 80-120m
- Aquifer type: Alluvial deposits
- Water quality: Generally good, some salinity in eastern areas
