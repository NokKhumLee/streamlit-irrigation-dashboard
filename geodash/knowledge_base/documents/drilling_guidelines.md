# Well Drilling Guidelines - Dan Chang District

## Pre-Drilling Assessment

### Site Selection
1. Check proximity to contamination sources (>30m from septic systems)
2. Verify property boundaries and access
3. Review existing well data in the area
4. Conduct preliminary geophysical survey if budget allows

### Optimal Locations
- Avoid low-lying flood-prone areas
- Select higher ground when possible
- Consider distance from distribution points
- Check for underground utilities

## Drilling Specifications

### Recommended Depths by Purpose
- **Domestic use**: 80-100m
- **Agricultural irrigation**: 100-150m
- **Commercial/Industrial**: 120-180m

### Well Diameter
- Domestic: 6-8 inches (150-200mm)
- Agricultural: 8-12 inches (200-300mm)

### Casing Requirements
- Steel or UPVC casing required
- Minimum thickness: 5mm for steel
- Screen length: 20-40% of productive zone

## Cost Estimation (2025 prices)

### Drilling Costs
- Average: 1,200-1,500 THB per meter
- Includes: drilling, casing, screen
- Does not include: pump, electrical, permits

### Example Total Costs
- 80m well: 96,000-120,000 THB
- 120m well: 144,000-180,000 THB
- 150m well: 180,000-225,000 THB

### Additional Costs
- Pump system: 30,000-80,000 THB
- Electrical connection: 20,000-50,000 THB
- Permits and testing: 5,000-15,000 THB

## Best Practices

### Timing
- Ideal months: May-June (early rainy season)
- Avoid: Peak dry season (March-April)
- Plan 2-3 weeks for completion

### Contractor Selection
- Verify licenses and insurance
- Check references and past projects
- Get detailed written quotes
- Ensure warranty coverage

### Post-Drilling
- Water quality testing required
- Development period: 1-2 weeks
- Regular maintenance schedule
- Monitor water levels seasonally

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Low Yield
- May need deeper drilling
- Consider pump placement depth
- Check for screen clogging

### Water Quality Issues
- Test for bacterial contamination
- Check mineral content
- May need treatment system

### Seasonal Fluctuations
- Normal in shallow wells (<60m)
- Deep wells more stable
- Plan for dry season capacity
