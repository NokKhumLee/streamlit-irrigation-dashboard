# Geological Profile - Dan Chang District, Suphan Buri

## Location
- Province: Suphan Buri
- District: Dan Chang (อำเภอด่านช้าง)
- Coordinates: 14.85-15.05°N, 99.50-99.75°E
- Elevation: 5-15m above sea level

## Geological Formation

### Surface Layer (0-10m)
- Clay and silt deposits
- Low permeability
- Seasonal saturation

### Upper Aquifer (10-50m)
- Sandy clay and fine sand
- Moderate permeability
- Seasonal water table fluctuation
- Vulnerable to contamination

### Middle Aquifer (50-150m) - PRIMARY TARGET
- Medium to coarse sand with gravel
- High permeability
- Stable water supply
- Best drilling target

### Deep Aquifer (150m+)
- Consolidated sediments
- Lower permeability than middle aquifer
- Very stable but expensive to access

## Hydrogeological Properties

### Water Table Depth
- Wet season: 5-15m
- Dry season: 15-30m
- Average: 20m

### Aquifer Productivity
- Transmissivity: 100-500 m²/day
- Specific yield: 15-25%
- Sustainable yield: 50-150 m³/day per well

### Water Quality
- pH: 6.5-7.5
- TDS: 200-600 mg/L
- Hardness: Moderate (150-300 mg/L as CaCO₃)
- Iron: Sometimes elevated (>0.3 mg/L)

## Success Factors by Location

### Eastern Dan Chang
- Better aquifer development
- Higher success rates (80-85%)
- Optimal depth: 90-120m

### Western Dan Chang
- More variable geology
- Success rate: 70-80%
- May need deeper drilling: 120-150m

### Central Dan Chang
- Most developed area
- High competition for water
- Recommend 100-130m depth

## Risk Factors

### High Risk Areas
- Former rice paddies with pesticide use
- Areas with industrial activity
- Locations near waste disposal sites

### Geological Challenges
- Clay lenses that reduce productivity
- Occasional limestone layers
- Variable sand thickness

## Recommendations

### Site Investigation
1. Review existing well logs within 500m
2. Check success/failure patterns
3. Consider geophysical survey for large projects

### Drilling Strategy
- Target middle aquifer (80-150m)
- Plan for continuous casing
- Budget for potential depth adjustments
- Have contingency for water testing
