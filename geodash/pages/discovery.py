    **üó∫Ô∏è Map Controls:** Use the checkboxes above the map to toggle layers
    
    **Map Legend:**
    - üü¢ **Green dots**: Successful wells (high water yield)
    - üî¥ **Red dots**: Failed wells (low/no water)
    - üî• **Heatmap**: Probability zones (red=high probability, blue=low)
    - üöú **Colored areas**: Farm boundaries
    - üìê **Blue areas**: Field boundaries
    
    **üíß Finding Optimal Drilling Locations:**
    
    1. **Look for clustering**: Bright red/orange heatmap areas with nearby successful wells
    2. **Avoid isolated failures**: Areas with many red dots indicate poor conditions
    3. **Check depth**: Most successful wells are 80-150m deep
    4. **Consider proximity**: Wells too close together compete for water
    5. **Seasonal timing**: Plan drilling for rainy season (May-October)
    
    **üéØ Best Discovery Zones:**
    - High heatmap intensity (red/orange)
    - Multiple successful wells nearby
    - Optimal depth range available
    - Good geological formation
